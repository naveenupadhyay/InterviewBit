# InterviewBit
This project combines data from various sources and creates a proper one month plan for an engineer to crack top tier companies.

Following areas one need to cover for pure engineering interviews :
1- Algorithms
2- DataStrcuture questions.
3- System Design.
While for 1) and 2) there are plenty of links available and should cover well for junior level profiles ,System design is one area which 
becomes difficult to crack.

How to approach System design questions :
1- Approach.
